Or crack, rather.</p><p>Clinically speaking, I had an &ldquo;open internal reduction of the right zygomatic arch&rdquo;. Meaning: my cheekbone was in pieces and my jaw and eye socket were also cracked. I literally had a broken face.</p><p>The following pages are some random thoughts I had during my recovery. This book was made to mark the end of the healing process. A cathartic reflection of my facial trauma.</p><p>It was also made as a thank you to the people in my life who took such good care of me during a time I couldn't do the two things I love most: eat and play football.</p>"
